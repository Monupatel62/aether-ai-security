# Repository specification: aether-ai-security

**Status:** Documentation baseline copied from the Aether AI master specification. Implementation status must be verified separately.

## Mission

Shared policy definitions, prompt/tool guardrails, secret-handling, redaction, and threat-model requirements.

## Dependencies and connections

Low-level cryptographic/policy utilities and an optional low-level telemetry interface. Higher-level runtime components consume versioned security contracts; this repository must not import API, agents, UI, or other consumers. Whether policy evaluation is a library or a separately deployed service remains open.

## Owned capabilities

Shared policy request/decision contracts, reusable enforcement primitives, input/output filtering guidance, PII redaction utilities, tool risk classifications and security event schema. Identity/session state and authoritative tenant/workspace membership are owned elsewhere; do not create a parallel identity or membership database.

## Must not own

- Responsibilities assigned to another repository in the master catalog.
- Secrets, identity decisions, or authorization bypasses outside its documented boundary.
- Private database tables owned by another service.
- Unversioned contracts or undocumented side effects.

## Policy contract boundary

Define versioned principal, action, resource, tenant/workspace context, decision, reason-code and obligation fields. Fail closed on missing/invalid context for protected actions. Callers remain responsible for invoking the policy contract at every resource/action boundary; a shared library or policy service does not replace domain enforcement. Security must not import its callers.

## Required contracts

- Typed schemas, explicit versioning, stable error categories, limits, and compatibility policy.
- Tenant/user context and authorization rules for any scoped data/action.
- Correlation IDs, safe telemetry, and explicit failure/timeout/retry behavior.
- Retention/deletion semantics whenever data is persisted.

## Security and privacy checklist

- [ ] Threat model and abuse cases documented.
- [ ] Least privilege and tenant isolation defined.
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded or redacted in logs.
- [ ] Input size/type validation and rate/usage limits defined.
- [ ] Deletion, retention, export, and audit requirements defined where applicable.

## Test plan

Unit tests, contract tests, authorization/tenant isolation tests, malformed-input tests, dependency failure tests, and a non-production integration smoke test are required before release. Tests use synthetic or sanitized data only.

## Implementation gates

1. Create the repository only when the owner and direct dependencies are ready.
2. Review this specification against [the master catalog](https://github.com/Monupatel62/aether-ai-platform/blob/main/docs/REPOSITORY_CATALOG.md).
3. Record an ADR for unresolved technology choices before selecting a database, identity provider, queue, cache, vector store, or payment provider.
4. Implement a minimal vertical slice with tests and operational docs.
5. Update the master catalog and this spec when the contract changes.
